* This release fixes an error generated by the previous version for 
Windows builds when re-building vignette outputs. Specifically, I added the
package 'ggmap' as a "Suggests", to make sure that it is available when 
re-building one of the vignettes. This version has been checked on win-builder, 
both devel and release, to confirm that the previous warning has been resolved. 
I also checked the package locally (OS X install, R 3.6.3) using '--as-cran' to
ensure that it passed all checks when using a user library containing only packages 
at least suggested. Finally, I updated all dependencies to use the latest version of 
each package and tested using these latest versions. I apologize for not sending in 
this update before March 31 to ensure the previous version of the package was not 
removed from CRAN. I apologize if my delay has caused more work for you, and I 
appreciate all the work that your team does to keep CRAN going.
