```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Purpose

Showing visualization examples that can be pulled from data.

```{r}
library(stormwindmodel)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

storm_data <- floyd_tracks
grid_data <- county_points
```


Use functions to pull storm data. In this case, winds
```{r}
wind_map_data <- calc_grid_winds2()
head(wind_map_data)
```

Basic Plot -  max wind speed at each location based on get_grid_winds, which pulls max from cal_grid_winds2 matrix
```{r}
base_plot <- get_grid_winds(storm_data, grid_data)
map_wind(base_plot)
```

New Plot - take all points at a specific time and plot
```{r}

county_data <- tigris:::counties(state = c("NC", "FL","GA","VA", "DE", "MD", "NJ", "PA", "NY","CT","RI", "MA", "NH", "VT", "ME"), cb = T, class = "sf")

practice <- right_join(base_plot, grid_data)
sf_plot <- sf:::st_as_sf(practice, coords = c("glon", "glat")) %>% 
   sf:::st_set_crs(4269)

#merge counties w/ fibs

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = county_data) +
  geom_sf(data = sf_plot, aes(color = vmax_sust))

```
